            <p>Movies and television shows can have a significant impact on our lives. They&apos;re portals to other worlds that frighten, amuse, shatter our hearts, and inspire us.</p> 
            <p>The best shows go above and above, serving as social change agents, altering public perceptions, and demonstrating resilience. We watch in terror as our heroes fall, and then we 
                fill with pride as they inevitably rise again. A hero&apos;s &ldquo;never give up&rdquo; attitude illustrates a resilience we may already possess or strive to acquire.</p>
            <p>Resilience and adaptation have been critical recently, as we have experienced unparalleled uncertainty and change. I've curated a selection of movies and series about resilience
                in everything in between if you need some inspiration or simply an escape to get your mind off of everything. <strong>Here are some of my picks&colon;</strong></p>
