		<h3>Please come in and stay awhile.</h3>
		<p>I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
		<p class="p2">If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>

		<h4>My guarantee</h4>
		<p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it for a full refund. <strong>No questions asked!</strong></p>
